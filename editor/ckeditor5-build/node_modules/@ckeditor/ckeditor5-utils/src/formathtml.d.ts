/**
 * A simple (and naive) HTML code formatter that returns a formatted HTML markup that can be easily
 * parsed by human eyes. It beautifies the HTML code by adding new lines between elements that behave like block elements
 * (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements
 * and a few more like `tr`, `td`, and similar ones) and inserting indents for nested content.
 *
 * WARNING: This function works only on a text that does not contain any indentations or new lines.
 * Calling this function on the already formatted text will damage the formatting.
 *
 * @param input An HTML string to format.
