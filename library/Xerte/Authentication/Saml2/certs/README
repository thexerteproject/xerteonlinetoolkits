This is the location where to put the SP certificate if signing the request is enabled (default since 3.15.4).

The certificate must be in PEM format and the file must be named `sp.crt`, `sp.key`.

You can create the certificates yourself using openssl:

openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout sp.key -x509 -days 365 -out sp.crt

Make sure the key does not have a passphrase, otherwise the signing will fail.

openssl rsa -in sp.key -out sp.key
