The Saml2 Authentication module is based on https://github.com/onelogin/php-saml

If you want to connect the Xerte installation to an IdP do the following:

1. Copy Sampl2.php.dist to Saml2.php. Only in very special circumstannces would you need to edit this file.
2. Copy the settings.php.dist file to settings.php and fill in the proper values for the contact details and your IdP.
   By default (since version v3.15.4) the settings.php.dist file requires the authentication request and the responses to be signed.
   That requires that you create a signing certificate. See certs/README on how to generate those.
   If you do not want this, you can switch of the requirement of signing the request and the response, but this does create a
   potential security risk!
3. Copy the endpoints/acs.php.dist file to endpoints/acs.php
   Normally if the IdP is standards compliant you should not need to adjust or change acs.php
   However, in case the IdP returns the Saml2 attrubutes in a different format than urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent,
   you might need to change the mapping of the Saml2 attributes to the proper $xertedata structure in acs.php.

   To help you figure out the correct mapping, set $sso_logging to true and try to login. Then check the sso.log file in the error_logs folder.


SingleLogout should work, but is not that well tested.

See the instructions on https://github.com/onelogin/php-saml for further detailed information.

IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTE
When upgrading an installation, no changes are enforced on settings.php and endpoints/acs.php. If you do not take action yourself in
reconfiguring the Saml2 IdP, chances are very high that Authentication Requests are not signed when Saml2 was set up prior to v3.15.
