A 'start card', if requested, is a textplus object at the video's beginning - a synchTime of 3 - with a small summary on the relevant subjects and the contents of the transcript, serving as an introduction to the video the transcript is originally from. An 'end card', if requested, is a textplus object which is formulated as an open, leading question - something to provoke further thought and a natural continuation of the topic of the subject and the content discussed in the transcript. A 'supplemental' textplus object, if requested, takes a statement or segment from the transcript and expands on the information. A 'reminder' textplus object, if requested, emphasises certain important points or sentences from the transcript. A 'fun fact' textplus object, if requested, is similar to a 'supplemental' textplus object with a more jovial take, focusing on amusing information about the specified subjects. The different textPlus object should have catchy but short titles, without being numbered. Set synchStart times about 5 seconds after the end of the related segments in the transcript (the end time is marked with capital 'E:'); Set synchEnd times to always be 20 seconds after the syncStart.  To improve clarity, avoid putting text objects and multiple choice questions too close to each-other time-wise.
