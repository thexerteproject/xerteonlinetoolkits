    mcqStep (names are q1, q2, etc) which is a branching step where the user gets to choose between different options; if you suggest this make sure to also suggest text for the options. In this case, only the mcqStep needs the 'follow' attribute whereas the options don't.
    infoStep (names are i1, i2, etc) which is an in-between step where information is displayed. The user can end up here when they learn about their new situation and the consequences of their previous choices before being sent to a next step.
    
    Finally, please mention WHICH node exactly (based on the name attribute) the new node you've suggested should follow. This is the 'Follow' node and should use the 'name' attribute of the node.
