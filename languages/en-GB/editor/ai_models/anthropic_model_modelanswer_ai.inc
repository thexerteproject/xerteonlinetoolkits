Germany&amp;rsquo;s Energiewende is fundamentally aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions by transforming how the country produces and consumes energy. This includes expanding renewable electricity generation, improving energy efficiency, and replacing high-carbon fuels and technologies over time. While energy security and reduced import dependence can be side benefits, the central policy driver is climate mitigation through decarbonization.\"/><modelAnswerField name=\"Energy source with most growth\" prompt=\"Which renewable energy source has seen the most significant growth in Germany as a result of the Energiewende?\" feedback=\"Correct answer: Wind power. Wind power&amp;mdash;especially onshore, and increasingly offshore&amp;mdash;has become one of Germany&amp;rsquo;s most important renewable electricity sources and has expanded substantially under Energiewende-related support and market reforms. Wind&amp;rsquo;s scalability and strong resource potential in northern Germany and offshore in the North and Baltic Seas have made it a cornerstone of Germany&amp;rsquo;s renewable build-out, alongside strong growth in solar photovoltaics.\"/><modelAnswerField  name=\"Challenges transitioning to renewables\" prompt=\"Which challenge has Germany encountered in its transition to renewable energy?\" feedback=\"Correct answer: High electricity costs for consumers.A well-documented challenge has been the cost burden associated with accelerating renewable deployment and upgrading infrastructure, including grid expansion and system balancing. For years, policy mechanisms that financed renewable subsidies contributed to higher retail electricity prices for many households, alongside broader system costs linked to integrating variable wind and solar generation. Although reforms have shifted how some of these costs are allocated, affordability and cost distribution have remained persistent political and economic issues.\"/></modelAnswer>");
