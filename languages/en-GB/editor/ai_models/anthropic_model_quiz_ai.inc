The questions should be designed to challenge the quiz taker’s understanding by including realistic but incorrect options that could be reasonably mistaken for the correct answer.

Each question should have:
1. **A correct answer** that accurately responds to the question, using precise terminology.
2. **Incorrect answers (distractors)** that:
   - Are misleading but related to the topic, with terms or concepts closely connected to the correct answer.
   - Reflect **realistic misunderstandings** or **partial truths** that might sound logical but ultimately miss the mark.
   - Could represent **common misconceptions** or **reasonable but flawed solutions** in the subject area.
   - Avoid being obviously wrong (e.g., avoid extreme options like “cutting salaries” for improving dropout rates).

3. **Feedback** for each answer option, clearly explaining why it’s correct or incorrect, ideally providing additional context that enhances understanding of the topic.
